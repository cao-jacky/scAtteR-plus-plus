## scAtteR server++

The server component of the `scAtteR++` system as described in the paper, "Characterizing Distributed Mobile Augmented Reality Applications at the Edge".

### Dependencies

  - `OpenCV` - tested with version 4.7.0
  - `CUDA` - tested with version 12.1
  - `grpc`
  - `nlohmann/json` for JSON structures in C++


The following depdencies are included as submodules in the repository
  - [`FALCONN`](https://github.com/cao-jacky/FALCONN.git) - CPU LSH, library modified from [FALCONN](https://github.com/FALCONN-LIB/FALCONN)
  - [`CudaSift`](https://github.com/Celebrandil/CudaSift) - CUDA version of SIFT with detection, extraction, matching
  - [`Eigen`](https://github.com/eigenteam/eigen-git-mirror) - Dense data structure
  - [`VLFeat`](https://github.com/vlfeat/vlfeat) - CPU GMM training

### Installation and compilation

Ensure that `OpenCV`, `CUDA`, and `grpc` are installed before following these instructions. There are considerable numbers of tutorials on how to do so, please find a relevant webpage online for these libraries. 

Here are the build instructions to get the `scAtteR++` server software succesfully running. VIM is used here, but feel free to use your favourite preferred code editor instead. 

```sh
# Ensure that the nlohmann/json library is installed
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nlohmann-json3-dev

# Clone the scAtteR++ repository and the required submodules
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/cao-jacky/scAtteR-plus-plus

# Configure the CudaSift library to replace old dependencies
cd server/lib/cudasift 

vim CMakeLists.txt 

# Update CMake version
:%s/cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.6)/cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.22)/g 

# Removing unnecessary REQUIRED parameter
:%s/find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED)/find_package(OpenCV)/g 

# Update the NVIDIA GPU architecture sm_xy version according to your hardware https://arnon.dk/matching-sm-architectures-arch-and-gencode-for-various-nvidia-cards/
:%s/sm_35/sm_60/g 

# Allow CudaSift to compile with any gcc version and not just gcc-6
:%s/gcc-6/gcc/g 

# Change CUDA to call a library and not an executable
:%s/cuda_add_executable/cuda_add_library/g 

# Save changes to CMakeLists.txt and quit
:wq

# Compile CudaSift
sed -i 's/executable/library/g' CMakeLists.txt
cmake -D CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/cuda -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .
make

# Update VLFeat library to function properly with scAtteR++ 
cd ../vlfeat

vim vl/kmeans.c
:%s/default(none)//g
:wq

# Return to scAtteR++ server's source files and compile
cd ../../src
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..

# When building scAtteR++, there may be several errors which occur. This is due to incompatabilities between libraries or NVIDIA GPU hardware, and must be debugged accordingly. We apologise that there cannot be more help with this. 
make 

```
### Running
The executable `server` can be used to run the different available services (`primary`, `sift`, `encoding`, `lsh`, `matching`) of the augmented reality pipeline. The following command can be used to run any of these services

```sh
./server service_name
```

You may notice that the services may not communicate to each other, as the default service IP and port settings need to be changed. This can be done by editing the `service_details_default.json` file in `data` and changing the `ip` and `port` variables. The services can be deployed on one machine through localhost or distributed amongst several nodes - the IP and port details should be changed accordingly. 

Here is an example service structure and explanations:
```json
{
    "service_name": "primary",  // the name of the service
    "order": 1,                 // the order of running, i.e., step in the pipeline
    "preprocessing": false,     // whether the service requires pre-processing of data 
    "server": {
        "ip": "10.30.100.1",    // the IP address of this service 
        "port": 50001           // the port of this service
    }
}
```

### Deployment specifications

The server was developed and tested on a machine with the following specifications:

- CPU: Intel Core i7-8700 3.20GHz x 12
- GPU: GeForce RTX 2080 Ti
- Memory: 32GB
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

Plus the program was compiled with the following CUDA/GCC/G++ compilers:

- CUDA: 12.1
- GCC: 11.4.0
- G++: 11.4.0
